The TSA releases data on their lost or damaged luggage claims annually. This project is concerned with approximating your likelihood of losing your luggage given a domestic airport and airline.

This project is currently in progress. Check back soon! In the meantime base data can be found [here](/assets/tsaluggageclaims/claims2002-2015.csv) (FYI 30+ Mb csv)
